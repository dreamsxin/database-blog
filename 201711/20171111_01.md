批量写入



create table feed(id int8 primary key, c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, c5 int, c6 int, c7 int, c8 int, c9 int, c10 int, c11 int, c12 int);




create or replace function tg1() returns trigger as $$
declare
begin 
  -- 规则定义，实际使用时，可以联合规则定义表
  perform pg_notify('channel_1', 'Resone:c2 overflow::'||row_to_json(inserted)) from inserted where inserted.c2>1000;  -- c2大于1000时，发送异步消息

  -- 多个规则，可以写多个notify，或者合并成一个NOTIFY。

  return null;
end;
$$ language plpgsql strict;




create trigger tg1 after insert on feed REFERENCING NEW TABLE AS inserted for each statement execute procedure tg1();
create trigger tg2 after update on feed REFERENCING NEW TABLE AS inserted for each statement execute procedure tg1();
